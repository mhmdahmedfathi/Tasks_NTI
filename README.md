## What to do ?

Every folder is a task done during certain interval of time 

Task1 - is about javascript DOM so you can train your javascript DOM skills and 
        learn how to use it by adding some elements to the page and removing others 
        So you can control all elements using javascript dom

Task2 - is about args in Nodejs and how to write arg and expect to get it in your code 
        and how you can handle any error that may come from it 

Task3 - make a simple project using nodejs as a backend and HBS as a frontend 
        and make it dynamic so you can add new clients and transactions and 
        see the changes in the page

Task4 - is to use mongodb in Task3 instead of writing in json file so you can deal with 
        data in mongodb and not in json file which is done in real life applications
                              
Task5 - is to use mongodb in Task1 instead of writing in local storage so you can deal with 
        data in mongodb and not in json file which is done in real life applications
