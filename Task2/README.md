### Add Customer

#### if you want to add client, you simply have to enter 2 args which are his name and his balance so you can type `node index.js AddCustomer --CustomerName=<name> --CustomerBalance=<balance>`

For adding name = mhmd and balance = 1500, you wil find the output in the console as this

```
Done Adding  {
  Customer: {
    accNum: 1655162844693,
    transactions: [],
    CustomerName: 'mhmd',
    CustomerBalance: 1500
  }
}
data added

```

then you want to add client but by mistake you didn't add any args or one of 2 args are missing , you will find the error message

```
index.js AddCustomer

responsable for Adding customer to mocking data

Options:
  --help             Show help                                         [boolean]
  --version          Show version number                               [boolean]
  --CustomerName     customer name                                    [required]
  --CustomerBalance  balance of the customer                          [required]

Missing required arguments: CustomerName, CustomerBalance
```

If you try to add customer with the same name, you will get this output in the console

```
 Sorry about that but Customer with this name already exists

```

If you try to add customer with balance < 0, you will get this output in the console

```
balance must be greater than zero
```

### Add Transaction

when you addTransaction the type can be only addBalance or Withdraw nothing else is accepted

#### then you want to add balance Transaction to the customer, you can type `node index.js AddTransaction --name=<name> --type=addBalance --balance=<balance>`

If the user is found you will see

```
data added
Done Adding  { Transaction: { type: 'addBalance', balance: 1500 } }

```

if the user is not exist,you will see

```
No Customer with this name found
```

#### so to add withdraw transaction, you can enter `node index.js AddTransaction --name=<name> --type=Withdraw --balance=<balance>`

if everything is corrected, then

```
data added
Done Adding  { Transaction: { type: 'Withdraw', balance: 1500 } }

```

if your balance is less than Withdraw balance, then

```
You can't withdraw Balance greater than your accual balance
